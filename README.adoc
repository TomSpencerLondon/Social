=== What is Social?

Social is a demo application of how to build authentication and authorization into your Spring Boot application with an
OAuth2 identity provider through GitHub.

=== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites
* installed - Git
* installed  - Java 11
* OAuth2 Client or App ID and Secret from the OAuth2 identity provider you are going to use for login. For example GitHub.

==== Creating OAuth2 identity provider app

Let's take GitHub as a demo identity provider

Go to https://github.com/settings/apps to create a new app and get Client ID and Client secret after creation.

It's also important to provide "User authorization callback URL" during app creation, so that GitHub will redirect to our application after a user authorizes.
For the demo purposes set it to `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/github`


==== Start the application

Clone the repository

`git clone git@github.com:TomSpencerLondon/Social.git`

After cloning the repository go to `src/main/resources/application-local.yml` and update you app GitHub ID and secret

```
github:
    client-id: <GITHUB APP ID>
    client-secret: <GITHUB APP SECRET>
```
On IntelliJ you can change the run configuration to use local environment:

After go to http://localhost:8080
